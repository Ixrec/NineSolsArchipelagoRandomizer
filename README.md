## What is an "Archipelago Randomizer", and why would I want one?

Let's say I'm playing Nine Sols, and my friend is playing Ocarina of Time. When I pick up the item dropped by Baichang, I find my friend's Hookshot, allowing them to reach several OoT chests they couldn't before. In one of those chests they find my Cloud Leap, allowing me to reach the Grotto of Scriptures. I retrieve the Shanhai 1000's map chip, and find my friend's Ocarina. This continues until we both find enough of our items to finish our games.

In essence, a multi-game randomizer system like Archipelago allows a group of friends to each bring whatever games they want (if they have an Archipelago mod) and smush them all together into one big cooperative multiplayer experience.
