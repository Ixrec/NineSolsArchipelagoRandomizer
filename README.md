# Nine Sols Archipelago Randomizer

A Nine Sols mod for [the Archipelago multi-game randomizer system](https://archipelago.gg/).

## Status

In Development (as of January 2024).

Nothing playable yet. Expect it to be a few months before we get a playable release.

## What is an "Archipelago Randomizer", and why would I want one?

Let's say I'm playing Nine Sols, and my friend is playing Ocarina of Time. When I pick up the item dropped by Baichang, I find my friend's Hookshot, allowing them to reach several OoT chests they couldn't before. In one of those chests they find my Cloud Leap, allowing me to reach the Grotto of Scriptures. I retrieve the Shanhai 1000's map chip, and find my friend's Ocarina. This continues until we both find enough of our items to finish our games.

In essence, a multi-game randomizer system like Archipelago allows a group of friends to each bring whatever games they want (if they have an Archipelago mod) and smush them all together into one big cooperative multiplayer experience.

## Roadmap

First playable release: Manage save files, connect to AP, start in FSP, actually shuffle the items and locations, various game state edits to keep all this playable, have defeating Eigong as the goal.

Features I probably do want to prioritize:
- random "spawn" / first root node
- randomizing jade computing power costs, just like HK rando
- randomizing the timing/conditions of 4 major scripted events: the Jiequan 1 & prison sequence, the Peach Blossom Village invasion, Lady E's soulscape unlocking, and Eigong's fight unlocking
- trap items (Sniper Trap? Prison State Trap? Internal Damage Trap? etc)
- randomize Wall Climb and Grapple starting abilities

Features I probably want, but not that soon:
- decide on additional goals, how to handle post-PonR content, and whether to do anything with the Chien/Chiyou/Shennong quests and True Ending
- hard/glitch/trick logic
- entrance randomization

Features I'm less sure about but am considering:
- randomizing shop items
- randomizing the skill tree
- turning root node unlocks into items, like HK's shuffle stag stations option
- in-game hints from the Shanhai 9000s
- randomize BGM
