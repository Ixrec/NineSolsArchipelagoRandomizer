  # https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/advanced_settings/en#universal-game-options

  # Many of these generic options accept "item name groups" and "location name groups".
  # For example: start_hints: ["Sol Seals"] or exclude_locations: ["Prison", "FMR"]
  # or priority_locations: ["Sol Fight Rewards"]

  # See the bottom of this file for complete lists of Nine Sols' item/location name groups.

    # Allows the Sol Seal items to be placed on any location in the multiworld, instead of their vanilla locations.

  seals_for_eigong:
    # The number of Sol Seals needed to open the door in Central Hall to New Kunlun Control Hub, fight Eigong,
    # and complete the goal.
    # Unlike the vanilla game, you don't need to visit Tiandao Research Center or trigger the "point of no return".
    #
    # You can define additional values between the minimum and maximum values.
    # Minimum value is 0
    # Maximum value is 8

  seals_for_prison:
    # The number of Sol Seals needed for Jiequan to appear in Factory (Great Hall), allowing you to "fight" him,
    # do the whole Prison escape sequence, and check most of the locations in Factory (Machine Room).
    # Note that you also need Mystic Nymph: Scout Mode before Jiequan will appear,
    # since you can't do the Prison escape sequence without it.
    # Unlike the vanilla game, the real Jiequan fight may be done before or after Prison, and it does not matter
    # which Sol Seals you've collected, only the total number.
    #
    # You can define additional values between the minimum and maximum values.
    # Minimum value is 0
    # Maximum value is 8

  seals_for_ethereal:
    # The number of Sol Seals needed for the entrance to Lady Ethereal's soulscape to appear in Cortex Center.
    # See also the skip_soulscape_platforming option.
    # Unlike the vanilla game, it does not matter which Sol Seals you've collected, only the total number.

    # You can define additional values between the minimum and maximum values.

    # Maximum value is 8

  skip_soulscape_platforming:
    # After you collect enough Sol Seals to unlock Lady Ethereal's soulscape (see seals_for_ethereal),
    # if this option is enabled, Cortex Center will skip ahead to the state where you can enter her boss fight,
    # instead of the long platforming sequence you normally do first.
    # 
    # This is a .yaml/generation option because it has a small effect on logic: The platforming sequence logically
    # requires Tai-Chi Kick, so skipping it allows the Lady Ethereal fight to be in-logic with only Air Dash.

  randomize_jade_costs:
    # Edit the cost of every jade in this slot to a randomly chosen number between jade_cost_min and jade_cost_max.
    # 
    # This includes jades which are not Archipelago items.

    # As a reminder: you start the game with 2 units of computing power, and there are 8 Computing Unit items to find,
    # for a maximum power of 10.
    'false': 50
    'true': 0

  jade_cost_min:
    # The minimum possible jade cost. Has no effect if randomize_jade_costs is false.

    # Maximum value is 10
