  version: 0.5.0 # Version of Archipelago required for this yaml to work as expected.

Nine Sols:
  # Generic Archipelago options. These are documented at
  # https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/advanced_settings/en#universal-game-options

  # Many of these generic options accept "item name groups" and "location name groups".
  # For example: start_hints: ["Sol Seals"] or exclude_locations: ["Prison", "FMR"]
  # or priority_locations: ["Sol Fight Rewards"]

  # See the bottom of this file for complete lists of Nine Sols' item/location name groups.

  seals_for_eigong:
    # The number of Sol Seals needed to open the door in Central Hall to New Kunlun Control Hub, fight Eigong,
    # and complete the goal.
    # Unlike the vanilla game, you don't need to visit Tiandao Research Center or trigger the "point of no return".
    #
    # You can define additional values between the minimum and maximum values.
    # Minimum value is 0
    # Maximum value is 8

    random-high: 0 # random value weighted towards higher values
    random-range-0-8: 0 # random value between 0 and 8

  seals_for_prison:
    # The number of Sol Seals needed for Jiequan to appear in Factory (Great Hall), allowing you to "fight" him,
    # do the whole Prison escape sequence, and check most of the locations in Factory (Machine Room).
    # 
    # Note that you also need Mystic Nymph: Scout Mode, Grapple, and either Cloud Leap or Ledge Grab
    # before Jiequan will appear, since you can't finish the Prison escape sequence without them.
    # 
    # Unlike the vanilla game, the real Jiequan fight may be done before or after Prison.
    # Also, it does not matter which Sol Seals you've collected, only the total number.
    #
    # You can define additional values between the minimum and maximum values.
    # Minimum value is 0
    # Maximum value is 8
    3: 50
    random: 0
    random-low: 0 # random value weighted towards lower values
    random-high: 0 # random value weighted towards higher values
    random-range-0-8: 0 # random value between 0 and 8

  seals_for_ethereal:
    # The number of Sol Seals needed for the entrance to Lady Ethereal's soulscape to appear in Cortex Center.
    # See also the skip_soulscape_platforming option.
    # Unlike the vanilla game, it does not matter which Sol Seals you've collected, only the total number.
    # The maximum is 7 instead of 8 because 8 would be incompatible with shuffle_sol_seals: false.
    #
    # You can define additional values between the minimum and maximum values.
    # Minimum value is 0
    # Maximum value is 7

  skip_soulscape_platforming:
    # After you collect enough Sol Seals to unlock Lady Ethereal's soulscape (see seals_for_ethereal),
    # if this option is enabled, Cortex Center will skip ahead to the state where you can enter her boss fight,
    # instead of the long platforming sequence you normally do first.
    # 
    # This is a .yaml/generation option because it has a small effect on logic: The platforming sequence logically
    # requires Tai-Chi Kick, so skipping it allows the Lady Ethereal fight to be in-logic with only Air Dash.
    'false': 50
    'true': 0

  prevent_annoying_runbacks:
    # If the path to a boss or other difficult arena fight has a shortcut requiring items to open,
    # this option makes those items logically required for the fight.
    # This prevents the randomizer from potentially forcing you to attempt these fights while they have
    # annoyingly long runbacks because you can't open the shortcuts yet.
    # 
    #     Two fights are currently affected by this option:
    #     - Ji's boss fight and the 3 locations behind it will logically require Mystic Nymph: Scout Mode,
    #     because nymph can open the shortcut from Grotto (West)'s root node to his boss arena
    #     - The location "Central Hall: Turrets and Double Axe Robot Room" will logically require Mystic Nymph: Scout Mode,
    #     because nymph can open the door to the left side of Central Hall

  # Jade Cost Randomization #
  ###########################
  randomize_jade_costs:

    # The costs may be any integer from 0 to 10, even if jade_cost_min and jade_cost_max are set to a narrower range.

  # Shop Unlocks #
  ################
  shop_unlocks:
    # The condition for unlocking the three shops in Four Seasons Pavilion. That is: Kuafu's shop, Chiyou's shop,
    # and Kuafu's extra inventory (visiting Chiyou outside FSP is considered out of logic)
    # 
    # - vanilla_like_locations means the shops are unlocked by checking AP locations that try to resemble the vanilla
    # game's unlock conditions (to the extent feasible in a randomizer).
    # In other words: Kuafu's shop is unlocked when you check the "Kuafu's Vital Sanctum" location,
    # Chiyou's shop is unlocked when you check the "Factory (GH): Raise the Bridge for Chiyou" location,
    # and Kuafu's extra inventory is unlocked at the same time as Chiyou's shop.
    # The main change from vanilla is unlocking Chiyou with the bridge location instead of the Prison escape sequence,
    # because forcing you to do the entire escape (up to Factory (Underground)) would be far too linear for a randomizer.
    # 
    # - sol_seals will unlock each shop after a certain number of Sol Seal items have been collected.
    # See kuafu_shop_unlock_sol_seals, chiyou_shop_unlock_sol_seals and kuafu_extra_inventory_unlock_sol_seals.
    # 
    # - unlock_items will add 3 "Progressive Shop Unlock" items to this slot, and unlock the 3 shops as they're found.
    # Since these are AP items, you can add them to start_inventory, local_items, and other generic options.

  #############################
  first_root_node:
    # The first root node you can teleport to from Four Seasons Pavilion after starting a randomized game.
    # This is often referred to as your "spawn", although you technically always spawn in FSP.
    # 
    # Many root nodes are intentionally excluded from this list, usually because if you started there
    # no locations would be checkable at the start of the game when you have no items yet.
    # 
    # Some first_root_nodes will force items to be placed early, since the randomizer would be unbeatable otherwise:
    # - galactic_dock early-places one of Nymph or Tai-Chi Kick
    # - central_transport_hub early-places Tai-Chi Kick
    # - factory_underground early-places one of Air Dash or Cloud Leap
    # - inner_warehouse early-places Wall Climb and one of Cloud Leap, Air Dash or Ledge Grab
    # - power_reservoir_west early-places one of Cloud Leap, Air Dash or Tai-Chi Kick
    # See the descriptions of shuffle_grapple, shuffle_wall_climb and shuffle_ledge_grab for additional cases.

  logic_difficulty:
    # `vanilla` is exactly what it sounds like: You will only be expected to do what the vanilla game required.
    # 
    # `medium` adds tricks that are easy to execute, once you're aware of them, but may require more effort to notice,
    # set up and/or retry after failure. Specifically:
    # - "Pseudo Air Dashes" using either a talisman ("T-dash") or Charged Strike ("CS-dash")
    # - Using a Cloud Piercer S (or X) arrow to break Charged Strike barriers without Charged Strike
    # - Using a Thunder Buster arrow (any level) to break one-way barriers from the "wrong" side
    # - "Bow Hover": Press and hold jump, shoot the bow immediately (during the first half of Yi's upward movement) with
    # any arrow equipped, and then simply never let go of the jump button until you're done hovering.
    # - Using the Swift Runner skill to jump with extra horizontal momentum
    # 
    # `ledge_storage` adds the following LS-related glitches to logic:
    #     - slash vault (also called LS "getup") or parry vault (also called LS "vault")
    #     - parry float/hover
    #     - moon slash wall slide
    # These are harder to explain, so if you would like to learn them, check out the Ledge Storage section of
    # Herdingoats' Nine Sols trick video: https://youtu.be/X9aii18KecU?t=766
    # To avoid the complications of skill logic, setting up ledge storage with a skull kick is out of logic. Logic will
    # assume you're doing the setup with either a Talisman dash, Air Dash, or Cloud Leap.
    # 
    # Other speedrun tech like respawn manipulation, low gravity, rope storage, invulnerability abuse, dashing
    # between lasers, and combinations thereof like fast Sky Tower climb and miner skip are simply out of logic.
    # No logic level will expect you to carry transient resources (azure sand, qi charges, ledge storage)
    # between areas, or increase your capacity beyond the initial 2 sand and 1 qi.
    # Parrying a flying enemy attack to reset platforming moves is only in logic at the one place in TRC
    # where the vanilla game gives you a respawning enemy for this specific purpose.
