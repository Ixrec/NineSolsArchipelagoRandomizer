// Many objects have a save data flag to record that Yi has already interacted with the object, so if
// the player ever comes back the object knows to be in its disabled/empty/post-interaction state.

// For some reason, the vital sancta for Ji, Fuxi and Nuwa set not just their own flags, but also the
// flag for Yanlao's VS. This appears to be a simple copy-paste error from RCG that has no impact in
// vanilla because it's supposed to be impossible to reach any of those VSs before Yanlao's.
// Hence, this normally only matters in speedruns that exploit this to skip Yanlao entirely.

// In randomizer, this can lead to the Yanlao's Vital Sanctum location being impossible to check
// because his VS simply turned off when you did one of the other VSs. So we have to prevent that.
